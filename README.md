# Advanced-Statistic-Inference
This exercise is based on the course **Advanced Statistic Inference (ASI)**  

The course focuses on the principles of learning from data and quantification of uncertainty, by complementing and enriching the Introduction to Statistical Learning course. In particular, the course is divided into two main parts that correspond to the supervised and unsupervised learning paradigms. The presentation of the material follows a common thread based on the probabilistic data modeling approach, so that many classical algorithms, such as least squares and k-means, can be seen as special cases of inference problems for more general probabilistic models. Taking a probabilistic view also allows the course to derive inference algorithms for a class of nonparametric models that have close connections with neural networks and support vector machines. This advanced course is complemented by lab sessions to guide students through the design and validation of the methods developed duringthe lectures.   

The exercise is based on MNIST and CIFAR 10 dataset, using naive bayses classifier and bayes linear classification to predict the label of the dataset. Both algorithms are implemented by myself instead of calling the existing package from sklearn, etc.  

All the code and comments are completed in the jupyter notebook "ASI exercise".
